  message.textContent = "Before this year ends, I just wanted to say of all the people that I've meet in my entire life span you we're by far the most extraordinary person that I've ever encountered,I like you not because of your appearance but bcuz of your actions and the way you teach others, I still even remember the time that I single handedly work on our case study and I was expecting of some kind of appreciation, but I was surprised that you rebuked me and corrected me in a way that I learned something valuable and life changing, i felt in that moment like damn are you my previous teacher? kddng hahahah, and also I like you bcuz you believe in God....do you still remember the first time you invited me to your church?. Before that I have no feelings for you as in nothing (not even a molecule hahahaha) but, on that faithful day I never thought that I get to experience joy and happiness agian. Especially on the worship part (i still can't believe we have the same worship music taste), when I saw you jumping,praising and singing before God I felt in that moment that the only people in the room was YOU, ME and GOD. Cuz that's the kind of vibe I'm looking for in a girl...like a girl who knows God and follow God, Intelligent, Beautiful, Brave, Kind, Helpful always guiding, smart and has a Sense of humor. Tbh Jus I see my self in you everytime I see you in class there was a time I said to my self 'bruh this girl has similar traits as me and oh btw ever wonder why I sometimes act dumb and stupid at class?... that was actually on purpose to see the true intentions of others and after analyzing every one's behavior you we're the only one that is similar to my behavior sometimes serious, sometimes childish and sometimes even stupid.. like bruh are you copying my entire being? kddng hahahah. Up until now I still can't believe that you surpassed all my standards that I thought no one could reach or a girl like that doesn't exist, but i was wrong. (you know what's the craziest part of me having a crush on you? is that I talk to God about you and prayed for you) .......but unfortunately as much as i like to make a move ( I don't even know how to make the first move and i don't even know if you like me or maybe I'm just delusional and assuming na gusto mo ako hahaha) but one thing I know is that you are just going to be another life lesson that God has put in my life and even tho it hurts so much. I still thank God that He brought you into my life, I wish I could tell you how I truly feel right now in person but you seems to be pre-ocupied every time and out of reach and you are probably wondering bakit di nalng sa chat ayaw ko kasing gumaya sa iba na sa chat aamin, i want to be different and unique and do this in a way that I am going to enjoy hehe, I was actually going to confess to you after the Jesus Reigns Celebration but since someone tag along I couldn't do it .So I've decided to confess through the one thing that I enjoy doing and that is coding i hope that after reading this when we meet again i hope that you will still talk to me or interact with me (it's ok if you don't sino ba naman ako hahahah). Any way I truly adore and like you Justin(in short Gusto kita) thank you for helping me become better and Thank you for being part of my life (I guess you are going to be my favorite lesson) but what if your the one hahaha but either way I pray to God that He may protect you and guide you at all times and bless you and that He may give you a peace of mind (Halata ko kase mahilig ka mag cram tas maiistress sa kaka cram hahahahaha). Thanks for reading this Justin God bless you..."
