      <p>Hi Justin, before this year ends, I just wanted to say of all the people that I've meet in my entire life span you we're by far the most extraordinary person that I've ever meet, i like you not because of your appearance but bcuz of your actions and the way you teach others, i still even remember the time that I single handedly work on our case study and I was expecting of some kind of appreciation but I was surprised that you rebuked me and corrected me in a way that I learned something valuable, and I like you bcuz you also believe in God, do you remember the first time you invited me to your church? before that I have zero feelings for you but, on that faithful day I never thought that I get to experience joy and happiness agian. Especially on the worship part, when I saw you jumping, praising and singing before God I felt in that moment that the only people in the room was YOU, ME and GOD. That's the kind of vibe I'm looking for in a girl or perhaps in a woman of God. Up until now I still can't still believe that you surpassed all my stanards that I thought no one could reach.......but unfortunately as much as i like to make a move (I don't even know how to make the first move haahhaah and i don't even know if you like me)but I know that you are just going to be another life lesson that God has put in my life but even tho it hurts. I still thank God that He brought you into my life I wish I could tell you how I truly feel in person but you seems to be pre-ocupied and out of reach, so I've decided to confess through one thing that I enjoy doing and that is coding i hope that after reading this our friendship will not be affected. I truly adore and like you Justin thank you for helping me become better and Thank you for being part of my life (I guess you are going to be my favorite lesson hahaha) idk if your the one but either way I pray to God that the one man destined to be with you will guide you and be there with you always when you need him.</p>
      <p>In short Gusto kita.</p>
      <p>From your annoying friend: Kevin, I hope this makes you smile . </p>
